# ML models from scratch only using numpy
 - In this project I have coded all the machine learning algorithms from scratch only using numpy

## 📘 Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm              | Type           | Status  |
|------------------------|----------------|---------|
| Linear Regression      | Supervised     | ✅ Done |
| Logistic Regression    | Supervised     | ✅ Done |
| K-Nearest Neighbors    | Supervised     | ✅ Done |
| (More coming soon...)  |                | 🚧 WIP  |

## 📚 Educational Value
- These implementations are great for:
- -Students learning machine learning fundamentals
- -Developers transitioning into ML roles
- -Understanding what happens behind sklearn.fit()
